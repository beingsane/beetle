# Beetle

> Pull a prank on your co-workers, sting their code and let them pull their hair out

Beetle is a little bash utility that let's you *sting* some piece of source code and make it stop working. While you won't see any changes in code, you will get errors when running it.

## How does it work?

It simply replaces the space character with an invisible character so when you will open the file, you won't see any change but actually the program won't work because of some syntax errors due to those invisible characters.

Of-course, *Beetle* is language agnostic and you can use it to pull a prank on anyone no matter what language they code in.

## Install

You can install it either using CURL

```bash
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamranahmedse/beetle/master/installer.sh | sudo sh
```

Or by cloning and manually installing it

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kamranahmedse/beetle.git
$ cd beetle
$ sudo make install
```


## Usage

```
$ beetle <sting|cure> <sourcecode-filepath>
```

## Stinging a file

Make any piece of code to stop working by

```bash
$ beetle sting Controller.php
```
