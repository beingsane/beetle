# Beetle

> You won't see any changes in the stinged code but you will get errors when running it

Beetle is a little utility that let's you *sting* some piece of source code and make it stop working. While **you won't see any changes in code**, you will get errors when running it.

Of-course, Beetle is language agnostic and you can use it to pull a prank on anyone no matter what language they code in.

## Install

You can install it either using CURL

```bash
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamranahmedse/beetle/master/installer.sh | sudo sh
```

Or by cloning and manually installing it

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kamranahmedse/beetle.git
$ cd beetle
$ sudo make install
```


## Usage

```
$ beetle <sting|cure> <sourcecode-filepath>
```

## Stinging a file

Make any piece of code to stop working by

```bash
$ beetle sting Controller.php
```

```
